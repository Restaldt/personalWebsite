			I have enjoyed gaming for most of my life. I currently play Monster Hunter World, Fallout, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, The Witcher 3, Dark Souls, and Overwatch. A few years ago I decided to teach myself how to assemble PCs. I have put together several builds for myself, my brother, and a few of my friends.

				I have been slowly upgrading this pc for about 4 years and I am still currently doing so. I am planning on upgrading the RAM and front fans next. 

				I also have a MacBook Air that I use and have experience with Ubuntu. 

				When I am not programming or gaming I am usually playing with either my cat, Maverick, or my dog, Rose.
