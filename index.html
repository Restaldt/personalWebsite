			I have enjoyed gaming for most of my life. I currently play Monster Hunter World, Fallout, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, The Witcher 3, Dark Souls, and Overwatch. A few years ago I decided to teach myself how to assemble PCs. I have put together several builds for myself, my brother, and a few of my friends.

				I have been slowly upgrading this pc for about 4 years and I am still currently doing so. I am planning on upgrading the RAM and front fans next. 

				I also have a MacBook Air that I use and have experience with Ubuntu. 

				When I am not programming or gaming I am usually playing with either my cat, Maverick, or my dog, Rose.

				About IPFS:
			</h3>
				<pre class = "preText">
					IPFS - the InterPlanetary File System is a recently developed hypermedia distribution protocol developed by Protocol Labs.

					It is a Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System. Files on IPFS are not IP addressed like files on HTTP networks are. Instead the address of a file is the hash of its contents. IPFS is similar to a a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. 

					Since the address of a file on IPFS is the hash of its contents any time you change any part of the file that new file has a completely separate address from the previous version. This content addressing has several inherent benefits over HTTP. 

					Files stored on HTTP networks only exist on a given server with a specified IP address. So if all of the servers that file exists on go down for some reason then that file is no longer accessible. HTTP also does not take into account the physical distance between the server and the client. IPFS attempts to address this by being a distributed file system in which the address of the file is the hash of its contents. Any computer on IPFS can store all of the files they are interested in and anyone who wants to access a specific hash can access those files through IPFS. So long as a node on IPFS has a specified file then that file can be accessed. 

					This can also lead to certain files having psuedo-permenance on the network. The more popular a file is on IPFS the more times it will be downloaded and stored and the more locations it can be pulled from.

					Version control systems are as simple as saving the hash of the previous version and accessing that hash when you want to access a previous version. 

					IPFS also has a mutable link system called IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System) which can be used as a mutable directory of immutable objects. Due to the content addressing of files on IPFS it can be difficult to find the latest version of a file because every new version has its own address. This is where IPNS comes in to play. It basically functions as a pointer that can be changed at any time to point to a specified IPFS hash.

					IPFS is also accessible through a HTTP gateway at ipfs.io/ipfs/[hash]. This means files uploaded to the file system can be accessed in pretty much any browser. IPNS also works in http at ipfs.io./ipns/[hash].

					Currently IPFS is still a work in progress. It still has a few bugs; IPNS for example is extremely slow. The link you have accessed is unable to be updated but you may be able to find an updated version of this website at:

					<a href = "https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmZFoS2p5a6xufJ5CEpnhWTqEbMZzELas6MV71Bw7kTThz">https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmZFoS2p5a6xufJ5CEpnhWTqEbMZzELas6MV71Bw7kTThz</a>


					I am very interested in the technology and would encourage you to go learn more at the following links:

			My Projects:

			</h3>

				Current Projects:
				<ol>
					<li>	
						This website: I am currently still in the process of building this personal website. I am planning on improving its overall look and content. I will also be teaching myself <a href = "https://reactjs.org/">react.js</a> and applying it in some way to the website.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Bitcoin autotrader: I will be working on a program that will use the <a href = "https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase API</a> to automatically buy and sell bitcoin. This will  be done in python using the Rest API from Coinbase to keep track of the price of bitcoin, buying at relative lows, and selling those specific amounts after the price has risen enough. Currently the project is just tracking the price of bitcoin and using a fake wallet while I work on it. After I am satisfied with the results it produces using the fake wallet I will give it access to a wallet with very limited funds to see if it can make any profits with this simple approach.

						I am also considering applying reinforcement learning to this project but for now I will stick with the simpler approach.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Cuphead reinforcement learning agent: For my Master's thesis I implemented a Supervised learning agent to play the first level of the game Cuphead. I was unable to get reinforcement learning to work at the time and would really like to implement it so that the agent can learn to play any level of the game. This project will involve python, tensorflow-gpu, and keras. 
					</li>
				</ol>


				Previous projects completed:


				<ul>
					<li>
						Cuphead agent:

					<li style="list-style-type: none;">
						In this project I used Python, Keras, and Tensorflow to create an agent capable of playing the first Run N' Gun level of Cuphead. I did this because I am quite interested in Artificial Intelligence and wanted to get some experience with the subject. This was my first project using both Tensorflow and Keras. I decided to use Supervised learning as I was unable to implement reinforcement learning at the time and wanted to see if it would even be possible for the agent to perform well on the level with just supervised learning. To train this agent I let it play the level for a  few minutes at a time and then sorted the resulting screenshots into labels. These labels represtented the move I felt the agent should make immediately after a given screenshot is taken. I then let the agent train on the newly sorted images and repeated this process until the agent succeeded in completing the level. 

						Overall I was surprised at how well the supervised learning approach worked as it only took about 60,000 images to get a successful run from the agent.

					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Dropbox-like program: I implemented a program that functioned similar to Dropbox using Java and IPFS. It was a program which uploaded files stored in a given directory on IPFS and provided a link to the files for future downloads and remote viewing. It was also capable of version control thanks to the content addressing of IPFS.  
					</li>

					<li>
						Conniptions Agent: I helped code an agent capable of playing the game Conniptions. Conniptions is similar to Connect 4 except the board can be flipped over before, after, or before and after a move 4 times by each player. To play this game I implemented a simple min-max algorithm that calculated the move which resulted in the most optimal boardstate for my agent.
